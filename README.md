## My past

I have been programming as a hobby which I have taken much more seriously within the past year. I created many mini projects for myself to practice with...I know, I have way too much time on my hands, and this ignited my passion for React and React Native. Working with React Native was my gateway to the software development bug...not a programming bug but the enjoyment kind of bug!

I loved working with new technologies and I loved how code that I type have a real effect on people. With the power of coding, I can save countless hours of work for someone, I can create a client database for someone who's storing information inefficiently (check out my full stack MERN application I did in my repo ["client_database_management"](https://github.com/Nimzyow/client_database_management)) and I can do whatever I imagine. It really fuelled my creativity and brought me joy.

Now, to get to what I've been up to these past few years. I was working as a Structural Engineer ever since I graduated from University for my family company. We did all of the architectural design and strucutral of buildings varying from small bungalows to multi storey apartments. It was a good experience and I got stuck into property developement too! It was good, however, it was never a real passion of mine as the hobby I was doing on the side, that would be programming in case you were wondering, kept me more fulfilled and engaged.

## What I'm doing now

I am currently a full stack software engineer at Ripple Energy. It's a fantastic working environment and we are encouraged to grow and make ourselves better everyday. I have taken the opportunity to upgrade my skills in React by working on it intensely within a commerical environmnet. I have also been encouraged to expand my skills and work in the backend which is a challenge since I have never worked with Django or Python prior to Ripple. However, my strongest skill of self learning has enabled me to take this challenge head on and I am making good progress with Django and Python.

Prior to working at Ripple Energy I finished a 16 week intensive bootcamp at Makers Academy to help fill in any knowledge gaps I have. They follow a TDD approach and they believe very strongly in the idea of collobaration through teamwork and pair programming.

TDD was somewhat of an eye opener as the whole concept of testing was just alien to me. Throughout the course I made TDD into a strong point of mine through materials given by Makers and through my own self led study, which even included me completing online courses on TDD. I now approach every application I make with TDD at the forefront.

We took part in pair programming every single day which involves tackling a week long challenge with a different pairing partner for each day. This presented a set of unique challenges for us as we are forced to work with people from different backgrounds and different viewpoints within a short space of time. In these pair programming sessions it's important we learn to adapt, communicate clearly and effectively and to practice empathy with one another. It is an extraordinary experience and has given me a surge of confidence when working with people. I believe this is what I value most from my time at Makers.

We are also tasked with working on group projects which involves us being placed in a random group of 4,5 or 6 people and to figure out how we make certain web applications. This experience was invaluable as much of my work has either been done in pairs or on my own.

The final project of Makers took us through a rollercoaster of a journey revealing the highs and lows of a team working environment. It involved us coordinating our thoughts, our approach, planning together, having an end of day retro everyday, assigning tasks that need completing each day, having disagreements and resolving those, oh and it involved us making a really cool application and presenting it, live! You can check the presentation out on this [link](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1854532374684301&ref=watch_permalink) where my group presents just after the 3 minute mark. This brief taste of what it's like to work in a team environment has further reinforced my desire to work in this industry.

## Skills with Repo reference

If I could endulge in a little bit of self endulgence I think the skills I would highlight are:

### Node, Express and React:

I created a Full Stack MERN application based on the final project I was a part of at Makers Academy. [DateSpot](https://github.com/Nimzyow/datespot). The entire application was TDD'd from beginning to end. The original projects front end state management was handled by React's Context API. I decided to switch state management to Redux through TDD. This was a great challenge that enabled me to learn and understand Redux further. The TDD of the backend was especially insightful and went through multiple reworks with the aim of it being more readable. Testing was done in Jest and Enzyme, Supertest, Mocha and Chai. I alaos switched the original projectsdatabase from SQL based to NoSQL, MongoDB.

During Makers we were asked to make a thermostat web application with Jquery and testing in Jasmine. I decided to take that idea and use Node.js, Express.js and SQlite for the backend and use React for the front. The TDD approach was taken using Jest and Enzyme for unit testing and Cypress for feature testing. [thermostat_node_react](https://github.com/Nimzyow/thermostat_node_react)

My first attempt at a full stack MERN application can be seen in my repo: [client_database_management](https://github.com/Nimzyow/client_database_management). I used hooks for better readability and context for state management. I also used Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB for the backend.

### Ruby on Rails and React

As part of our final project in Makers, we were tasked with creating an application to present to a live audience in just over a week. This project, called DateSpot, was challenging not just from a technical perspective, but from the perspective of working in a team enviornment and getting the best out of everyone in the team. Overall, we were very successful and created an awesome application with the backend done on Ruby on Rails, set up as an API and the frontend being done entirely in React with Reacts Context API for state management. The link to the repo: [DateSpot](https://github.com/rafahg/travel-final-project). The presentation for this project can be found on the following link just after the 3 minute mark: [Presentation](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1854532374684301&ref=watch_permalink)

### React Native:

After DateSpot I decided to create the React Native version so that I could try out a new testing framework. Basically, I wanted to see this run natively on my phone! [DateSpot](https://github.com/Nimzyow/datespot). The entire application was TDD'd from beginning to end. Since I was TDD'ing with react-native-testing-library, it required a lot of playing around but I found it very intuitive and brilliant, in fact. Since the backend and front end of the application were decoupled when I created the React version, it was relatively straight forward to TDD this application.

My first attempt at making an Engineering application for iOS and Android can be seen in my repo "iEngineer". It was a great learning experience and taught me many things, particularly about the horrors of not keeping clean code. Again, I kept this repo there to remind myself how I started.

### Redux:

The repo [ITLogger](https://github.com/Nimzyow/ITLogger) is a ITLogger application created with Redux for state management. It was created to dimystify the whole process of Redux. [ReduxLearning](https://github.com/Nimzyow/ReduxLearning) is a simple repo created to internalize the basics of Redux.

## Hobbies and other interesting things

I absolutely adore Scuba Diving and if I ever go on vacation, some scuba diving has to be involved! It is a real passion of mine and I adore looking at the different marine life and learning about them. Ship wrecks are also awesome and they fascinate me to no end!

![scuba](https://github.com/Nimzyow/CV/raw/master/media/PA280059rr.JPG)

I can speak Japanese to a near fluent level and have many friends in Japan who I love talking to. I learnt Japanese bit by bit over a number of years and I became obsessed with improving myself. This led to me making life long friends who I love dearly.

![travel](https://github.com/Nimzyow/CV/raw/master/media/P1010822.jpg)

Travel is probably a typical hobby that everyone has to put on their list. However, it really is something I love to do as it allows me to experience different cultures and people and to learn things from them. I often come back with a new perspective in life and a new way of looking at things.

Photography and the art of photography is something that really inspires me. I have a website www.foreverintransit.com which showcases some of my photography. My instagram is more up to date though and you can see that in the website I just linked.
