# A little about me

My name is Nima Soufiani, I know, kind of a rare name and a nightmare to spell for others. I'm a highly driven developer/engineer with a passion for AWS infrastructure, AWS Architecture and serverless development. My ability to learn and absorb information has led met to pursue and develop my skills within the AWS space. I have recently gained qualification as a AWS Certified Solutions architect - associate and have taken on responsibilities for managing and advising on cloud infrastructure within Ripple Energy. I also champion and develop serverless architectures for the different services at Ripple Energy to drive down costs, increase scalability and resiliency as well as improving on security for our cloud infrastructure.

## My past

During one of my many travels to Japan, I came across as a software developer working in Silicon Valley in 2018. After expressing my interest in software development and showing him my attempt at creating a Scuba Diving application for mobile with Unity and C# (I didn't know any better at the time), he showed me React Native and briefly gave me a rundown of what I needed to learn if I wanted a career as a Software Engineer.

After that fateful day, I very quickly became hooked on coding, like it was my true calling. I was endlessly sitting in cafes, going through Udemy courses like some prime time Netflix show and endlessly creating, testing and experimenting with different technologies.

Soon after, I finished a 16 week intensive bootcamp at Makers Academy to help fill in any knowledge gaps I have. They follow a TDD approach and they believe very strongly in the idea of collobaration through teamwork and pair programming.

## What I'm doing now

Fast forward to now I'm proud to have now become a highly capable Full Stack developer with a passion for AWS serverless computing. I now regularly spend my time spinning up lambda functions and creating queues doing all sorts of compute triggered by all sorts of events.

Working for a fast moving startup like Ripple Energy for 2 years as a Full Stack Software Engineer, I have had the unique opportunity to play a big part in the development process and modernise different areas of the codebase from frontend, backend to DevOps including utilisation of AWS services such as EKS, S3, EC2, Lambda, SQS, SNS, IAM and more.

I spear headed and implemented Ripple Energyâ€™s first and subsequent serverless microservices solutions by writing infrastructure as code using SAM template files. This has enabled us to easily create scalable and secure cloud resources while following the principles of least privilege when creating IAM policies, all while saving on costs.

I'm a qualified AWS Certified Solutions Architect - associate and am actively working towards a qualification for AWS Certified Developer - associate. The more I delve into the Serverless world the more I geek out over the fact that I can create an ecosystem where a developer only has to worry about code and not infrastructure. I'm constantly fascinated by how I can make different services work together to create a cost effective, highly scalable and durable infrastructure for web applications that live in the cloud. My hope is to be working more in this field in the future.

## Skills with Repo reference

### AWS Serverless access keys rotation

After passing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - associate exam, I felt that I wanted to use my skills in a meaningful way, straight away. After making an assessment on security regarding our cloud infrastructure, I felt it was necessary to automate our AWS Access keys to follow security best practices.

I decided this would be a fantastic first dip into the serverless world and I decided to create: [AWS Serverless access keys rotation](https://github.com/Nimzyow/aws-serverless-access-keys-rotation).

There were many services that were of interest to me such as SQS, SNS, SES, Lambda etc.. and I was eager to experiment with these services by writing a SAM template file. But first, I had to diagram the architecture out, which I have included in the repo. After that, it was onto writing SAM template files.

This was a great lesson in writing infrastructure as code. I had a lot of fun creating resources for lambda functions, SQS queues, SNS topics, DynamoDB table, SES and a Cloudwatch Schedule event. I also made extensive use of the @aws-sdk to write my lambda functions.

I also developed the Github Actions flow with the help of the `sam pipeline` to automate safe deployments from my staging to production account.

This project was also unit tested using jest unit testing and the lambda functions were written in TypeScript to increase resiliency within the lambda functions.

Plans for the future is to convert this project into step functions as I feel step functions are a more appropriate solution to the many Lambda + SQS queues that are currently here. But one learns from repetition which is why it was architected the way it was.

Overall, this was a great first taste into the serverless world and this project really got me eager to do more projects within the AWS ecosystem.

### Node, Express and React:

I created a Full Stack MERN application based on the final project I was a part of at Makers Academy. [DateSpot](https://github.com/Nimzyow/datespot). The entire application was TDD'd from beginning to end. The original projects front end state management was handled by React's Context API. I decided to switch state management to Redux through TDD. This was a great challenge that enabled me to learn and understand Redux further. The TDD of the backend was especially insightful and went through multiple reworks with the aim of it being more readable. Testing was done in Jest and Enzyme, Supertest, Mocha and Chai. I alaos switched the original projectsdatabase from SQL based to NoSQL, MongoDB.

During Makers we were asked to make a thermostat web application with Jquery and testing in Jasmine. I decided to take that idea and use Node.js, Express.js and SQlite for the backend and use React for the front. The TDD approach was taken using Jest and Enzyme for unit testing and Cypress for feature testing. [thermostat_node_react](https://github.com/Nimzyow/thermostat_node_react)

My first attempt at a full stack MERN application can be seen in my repo: [client_database_management](https://github.com/Nimzyow/client_database_management). I used hooks for better readability and context for state management. I also used Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB for the backend.

### Ruby on Rails and React

As part of our final project in Makers, we were tasked with creating an application to present to a live audience in just over a week. This project, called DateSpot, was challenging not just from a technical perspective, but from the perspective of working in a team enviornment and getting the best out of everyone in the team. Overall, we were very successful and created an awesome application with the backend done on Ruby on Rails, set up as an API and the frontend being done entirely in React with Reacts Context API for state management. The link to the repo: [DateSpot](https://github.com/rafahg/travel-final-project). The presentation for this project can be found on the following link just after the 3 minute mark: [Presentation](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1854532374684301&ref=watch_permalink)

### React Native:

After DateSpot I decided to create the React Native version so that I could try out a new testing framework. Basically, I wanted to see this run natively on my phone! [DateSpot](https://github.com/Nimzyow/datespot). The entire application was TDD'd from beginning to end. Since I was TDD'ing with react-native-testing-library, it required a lot of playing around but I found it very intuitive and brilliant, in fact. Since the backend and front end of the application were decoupled when I created the React version, it was relatively straight forward to TDD this application.

My first attempt at making an Engineering application for iOS and Android can be seen in my repo "iEngineer". It was a great learning experience and taught me many things, particularly about the horrors of not keeping clean code. Again, I kept this repo there to remind myself how I started.

### Redux:

The repo [ITLogger](https://github.com/Nimzyow/ITLogger) is a ITLogger application created with Redux for state management. It was created to dimystify the whole process of Redux. [ReduxLearning](https://github.com/Nimzyow/ReduxLearning) is a simple repo created to internalize the basics of Redux.

## Hobbies and other interesting things

I absolutely adore Scuba Diving and if I ever go on vacation, some scuba diving has to be involved! It is a real passion of mine and I adore looking at the different marine life and learning about them. Ship wrecks are also awesome and they fascinate me to no end!

![scuba](https://github.com/Nimzyow/CV/raw/master/media/PA280059rr.JPG)

I can speak Japanese to a near fluent level and have many friends in Japan who I love talking to. I learnt Japanese bit by bit over a number of years and I became obsessed with improving myself. This led to me making life long friends who I love dearly.

![travel](https://github.com/Nimzyow/CV/raw/master/media/P1010822.jpg)

Travel is probably a typical hobby that everyone has to put on their list. However, it really is something I love to do as it allows me to experience different cultures and people and to learn things from them. I often come back with a new perspective in life and a new way of looking at things.

Photography and the art of photography is something that really inspires me. I have a website www.foreverintransit.com which showcases some of my photography. My instagram is more up to date though and you can see that in the website I just linked.
