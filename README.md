## A little about me

My name is Nima Soufiani, I know, kind of a rare name and a nightmare to spell for others. I am Structural Engineer turned aspiring software developer looking for a wonderful company with an amazing team to work with and contribute all of what I know to. 

I have been programming as a hobby which I have taken much more seriously within the past year. I created many mini projects for myself to practice with...I know, I have way too much time on my hands, and this ignited my passion for React and React Native. Working with React Native was my gateway to the software development bug...not a programming bug but the enjoyment kind of bug!

I love working with new technologies and I love how code that I type have a real effect on people. With the power of coding, I can save countless hours of work for someone, I can create a client database for someone that is storing that sort of information inefficiently (check out my full stack MERN application I did in my repo called "client_database_management") and I can do whatever I imagine. 

Now, to get to what I've been up to these past few years. I was working as a Structural Engineer ever since I graduated from University for my family company. We did all of the architectural design and strucutral of buildings varying from small bungalows to multi storey apartments. It was a good experience and I got stuck into property developement too! It was good however, it was never a real passion of mine as the hobby I was doing on the side, that would be programming in case you were wondering, kept me more fulfilled and engaged. 

## Skills with Repo reference

If I could endulge in a little bit of self endulgence I think the skills I would highlight are:

React: I created many mini projects and I have even created a real full stack MERN application which can be seen on my repo called "client_database_management". I used hooks, context, Node.js and Express.js to make that which was great! Other React applications on my repo include "githubfinder" and "StructureReport". StructureReport was my time creating a React application, and my first time creating a real application to be used in real life, so it's rough but the roughness taught me many invaluable things. 

React Native: This was my entry into software development. My most recent React Native application on my repo is "Scuba_diver" using hooks and context as well as Node.js and Express.js. I created this application with the mindset of creating code that is easy to read and change. My first attempt at making an Engineering application for iOS and Android can be seen in my repo "iEngineer". It was again, a great learning experience and taught me many things. 

Redux: My github repo "ITLogger" is a ITLogger application created with Redux for state management. "ReduxLearning" is a simple repo to teach me the basics of Redux.

Javascript: As React and React Native uses Javascript and I have been programming with Javascript seriously for around a year, I believe I can call myself competant in this. I have also created a github repo called "javascript-kata" which I enter any interesting kata I do.
