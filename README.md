## A little about me

My name is Nima Soufiani, I know, kind of a rare name and a nightmare to spell for others. I am Structural Engineer turned aspiring software developer looking for a wonderful company with an amazing team to work with and contribute all of what I know to. 

I have been programming as a hobby which I have taken much more seriously within the past year. I created many mini projects for myself to practice with...I know, I have way too much time on my hands, and this ignited my passion for React and React Native. Working with React Native was my gateway to the software development bug...not a programming bug but the enjoyment kind of bug!

I love working with new technologies and I love how code that I type have a real effect on people. With the power of coding, I can save countless hours of work for someone, I can create a client database for someone who's storing information inefficiently (check out my full stack MERN application I did in my repo called "client_database_management") and I can do whatever I imagine. 

Now, to get to what I've been up to these past few years. I was working as a Structural Engineer ever since I graduated from University for my family company. We did all of the architectural design and strucutral of buildings varying from small bungalows to multi storey apartments. It was a good experience and I got stuck into property developement too! It was good however, it was never a real passion of mine as the hobby I was doing on the side, that would be programming in case you were wondering, kept me more fulfilled and engaged. 

## Skills with Repo reference

If I could endulge in a little bit of self endulgence I think the skills I would highlight are:

React: I created many mini projects and I have even created a real full stack MERN application which can be seen on my repo called "client_database_management". I used hooks and context for better readability and state management. I also used Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB for the backend. Other React applications on my repo include "githubfinder" and "StructureReport". StructureReport was my first time creating a React application, so it's rough but the roughness taught me many invaluable things. I keep it there to remind me where I started from and how far I've come. 

React Native: This was my entry into software development. My most recent React Native application on my repo is "Scuba_diver". I used hooks and context to develop this application . I created this application with the mindset of creating code that is easy to read and change. My first attempt at making an Engineering application for iOS and Android can be seen in my repo "iEngineer". It was again, a great learning experience and taught me many things. Again, I kept this repo there to remind myself how I started. 

Redux: My github repo "ITLogger" is a ITLogger application created with Redux for state management. It was created to dimystify the the whole process of Redux. "ReduxLearning" is a simple repo to teach me the basics of Redux.

Javascript: As React and React Native uses Javascript and I have been programming with Javascript seriously for around a year, I believe I can call myself competant in this. I have also created a github repo called "javascript-kata" which I enter any interesting kata I do.

TDD with RSpec: Having taken a course on TDD with Ruby, I decided to experiment with a variety of different matchers which can be seen on the repo "rspec_practice". After experimenting with simple examples, I took on a more complicated example, recreating the PADI Scuba diving table using RSpec and Ruby. This can be found on the repo "scuba_diver_tdd".

## Hobbies and other interesting things (I hope) about me

I absolutely adore Scuba Diving and if I ever go on vacation, some scuba diving has to be involved! It is a real passion of mine and I adore looking at the different marine life and learning about them. Ship wrecks are also awesome and they fascinate me to no end!

I can speak Japanese to a near fluent level and have many friends in Japan who I love talking to. I learnt Japanese bit by bit over a number of years and I became obsessed with improving myself. This led to me making life long friends who I love dearly. 

Travel is probably a typical hobby that everyone has to put on their list. However, it really is something I love to do as it allows me to experience different cultures and people and to learn things from them. I often come back with a new perspective in life and a new way of looking at things.

Photography and the art of photography is something that really inspires me. I have a website www.foreverintransit.com which showcases some of my photography. My instagram is more up to date though and you can see that in the website I just linked. There is a real rush whenever I decide to go out with just my camera and explore the city of London.
