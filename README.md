# A little about me

## `Summary`

My name is Nima Soufiani, I know, kind of a rare name and a nightmare to spell for others. I'm a highly driven JavaScript developer with a passion for React and React Native. My ability to learn and absorb information has led met to pursue the latest technologies while maintaining clean and understandable code.

## `My past`

I have been programming as a hobby which I have taken much more seriously within the past year. I created many mini projects for myself to practice with...I know, I have way too much time on my hands, and this ignited my passion for React and React Native. Working with React Native was my gateway to the software development bug...not a programming bug but the enjoyment kind of bug!

I loved working with new technologies and I loved how code that I type have a real effect on people. With the power of coding, I can save countless hours of work for someone, I can create a client database for someone who's storing information inefficiently (check out my full stack MERN application I did in my repo called "client_database_management") and I can do whatever I imagine. It really fuelled my creativity and brought me joy.

Now, to get to what I've been up to these past few years. I was working as a Structural Engineer ever since I graduated from University for my family company. We did all of the architectural design and strucutral of buildings varying from small bungalows to multi storey apartments. It was a good experience and I got stuck into property developement too! It was good, however, it was never a real passion of mine as the hobby I was doing on the side, that would be programming in case you were wondering, kept me more fulfilled and engaged.

## `What I'm doing now`

I'm currently in a 16 week intensive bootcamp at Makers Academy to help fill in any knowledge gaps I have. They follow a TDD approach and they believe very strongly in the idea of collobaration through teamwork and pair programming.

TDD was somewhat of an eye opener as the whole concept of testing was just alien to me. Throughout the course I made TDD into a strong point of mine through materials given by Makers and through my own self led study, which even included me completing online courses on TDD. I now approach every application I make with TDD at the forefront.

We take part in pair programming every single day which involves tackling a week long challenge with a different pairing partner for each day. This presents a set of unique challenges for us as we are forced to work with people from different backgrounds and different viewpoints within a short space of time. In these pair programming sessions it's important we learn to adapt, communicate clearly and effectively and to practice empathy with one another. It is an extraordinary experience and has given me a surge of confidence when working with people. I believe this is what I value most from my time so far at Makers.

We are also tasked with working on group projects which involves us being placed in a random group of 4,5 or 6 people and to figure out how we make certain web applications. This experience was invaluable as much of my work has either been done in pairs or on my own. It involved us coordinating our thoughts, our approach, planning together, having an end of day retro everyday, assigning tasks that need completing each day, having disagreements and resolving those, oh and it involved us making a clone of AirBnb! This brief taste of what it's like to work in a team environment has further reinforced my desire to work in this industry.

## `Skills with Repo reference`

If I could endulge in a little bit of self endulgence I think the skills I would highlight are:

### `Node, Express and React:`

I created a full stack MERN application which can be seen on my repo called "client_database_management". I used hooks and context for better readability and state management. I also used Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB for the backend.

During Makers we were asked to make a thermostat web application with Jquery and testing in Jasmine. I decided to take that idea and use Node.js, Express.js and SQlite for the backend and use React for the front. The TDD approach was taken using Jest and Enzyme for unit testing and Cypress for feature testing. this repo is called "thermostat_node_react".

Other React applications on my repo include "githubfinder" and "StructureReport". StructureReport was my first time creating a React application, so it's rough but the roughness taught me many things. I keep it there to remind me where I started from and how far I've come.

### `React Native:`

React Native was my entry into software development. My most recent React Native application on my repo is "Scuba_diver". I used hooks and context to develop this application . This application was created with the mindset of creating code that is easy to read and change.

My first attempt at making an Engineering application for iOS and Android can be seen in my repo "iEngineer". It was a great learning experience and taught me many things, particularly about the horrors of not keeping clean code. Again, I kept this repo there to remind myself how I started.

### `Redux:`

My github repo "ITLogger" is a ITLogger application created with Redux for state management. It was created to dimystify the whole process of Redux. "ReduxLearning" is a simple repo created to internalize the basics of Redux.

### `Javascript:`

As React and React Native uses Javascript and I have been programming with Javascript seriously for around a year. I have also created a github repo called "javascript-kata" which I enter any interesting kata I do.

### `TDD:`

Having taken a course on TDD with Ruby, I decided to experiment with a variety of different matchers which can be seen on the repo "rspec_practice".

After that, I took on a more complicated example, recreating the PADI Scuba diving table using RSpec and Ruby. This can be found on the repo "scuba_diver_tdd".

At Makers we had to create a thermostat app using Javascript, HTML and CSS but though a TDD approach using Jasmine. The skills I learnt from RSpec were easily transfarable to Jasmine which helped me get to grips with TDD with Jasmine very quickly.

The repo "thermostat_node_react" demonstrates my ability to thoroughly test a React application with Cypress, Jest and Enzyme. Since the approach to testing with Jest and Enzyme is different to how I usually tested with RSpec and Jasmine, it was challenging but interesting at the same time. Once I understood the concept of shallow rendering, the process of unit testing a React application became second nature. Cypress also allowed me to feature test my application and since its use is very similar to Capybara, I was able to get to grips with Cypress very quickly and was testing away in no time.

The firms handling of client information required modernising. I developed a full stack client database web application to help staff with client database management. Currently working on React Native version.

**Achievements include:**

✓ Staff can now create, read and update clients.

✓ Enabled functionality to drastically reduce search time for projects with associated clients

✓ Staff are now able to add tasks to each client to better visualise what tasks are left outstanding.

✓ Enabled authentication and encryption to ensure safety of client details.

Languages, Frameworks and Tools: React, Hooks and Context, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB. Currently planning on the React Native version of the same application.

`Civil Engineers Ltd (August 2012 to December 2019)`

_Structural Engineer_

Worked as part of a team on up to 12 commercial and residential projects a month ranging in Capex investment and asset value from £50k to £1m.

## Hobbies and other interesting things (I hope) about me

I absolutely adore Scuba Diving and if I ever go on vacation, some scuba diving has to be involved! It is a real passion of mine and I adore looking at the different marine life and learning about them. Ship wrecks are also awesome and they fascinate me to no end!

I can speak Japanese to a near fluent level and have many friends in Japan who I love talking to. I learnt Japanese bit by bit over a number of years and I became obsessed with improving myself. This led to me making life long friends who I love dearly.

Travel is probably a typical hobby that everyone has to put on their list. However, it really is something I love to do as it allows me to experience different cultures and people and to learn things from them. I often come back with a new perspective in life and a new way of looking at things.

Photography and the art of photography is something that really inspires me. I have a website www.foreverintransit.com which showcases some of my photography. My instagram is more up to date though and you can see that in the website I just linked.
